User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

User Story #4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
User Story #5: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

User Story #7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
