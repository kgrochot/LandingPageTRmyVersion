                    <p>Riding inside means that you won’t get the benefit of the natural airflow you’d get outside. One
                        of the biggest and most frequent mistakes we see in indoor setups is a lack of cooling. To
                        prevent overheating, use a fan that can blow a concentrated airstream at the body’s core. A
                        blower-style fan is a better choice than a box fan because it puts out a tremendous amount of
                        air in a focused stream.</p>

                    <p>Whether you like to listen to music or watch a show while you train indoors, a great set of
                        headphones can seriously improve your experience. For longevity, you’ll want a pair that has an
                        IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. If you’re a heavy sweater, you’ll want something
                        with a higher rating. Additionally, active noise cancellation is another nice feature to block
                        fan noise so you can listen to your entertainment. Some of our personal favorites are the Apple
                        Airpods Pro, Beats Fit Pro, and Jaybird Vista 2.</p>

                    <p>Even with your cooling dialed in, you’ll probably still work up a good sweat during a workout,
                        and the stem and headset take the brunt of your hard work. Over time, sweat can corrode bolts,
                        bearings, and expensive components. To help prevent sweat from getting there in the first place,
                        a simple sweat guard is very effective. These types of sweat guards loop around the seat post
                        and then attach to the handlebars.</p>
